## Pre-order Traversal

<ol>
<li>Visit root.</li>
<li>Traverse left subtree.</li>
<li>Traverse right subtree.</li>
</ol>

## In-order Traversal

<ol>
<li>Traverse the left subtree.</li>
<li>Visit root.</li>
<li>Traverse right subtree.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Per <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/992/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>, "Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal."</i></p>

## Post-order Traversal

<ol>
<li>Traverse the left subtree.</li>
<li>Traverse right subtree.</li>
<li>Visit root.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Per <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/992/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>, "when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order. That is to say, when you delete a node, you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.</p>

<p>Also, post-order is widely use in mathematical expression."</i></p>

## Level-order Traversal

<p><b>Breadth First Search:</b> 1. Visit root node. 2. Travese its neighbors. 3. Traverse its second level neighbors. 4, et. al: And so on...</p>

<p><i>Per <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/990/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>, "Typically, we use a queue to help us to do BFS."</p>
